<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>My name is Mike Tintes. I'm a DevOps Engineer by trade, but above that I am a tinkerer. I've done standup, been a radio dj, and I enjoy building things that pop into my head. I also love college hockey, so that might be coming up.</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>This blog is going to be about all of the different project I've worked on or interesting anecdotes, and maybe some stories along the way. I really believe that knowledge should be shared and documented so if you want more detail feel free to ask.</p>
  
<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Maybe a new post every couple weeks? I only want to put out stuff that seems interesting so I will write when those stars align.
