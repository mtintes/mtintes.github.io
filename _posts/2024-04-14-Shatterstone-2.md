[Last time](https://anmtblog.com/shatterstone/2024/04/07/Shatterstone1.html) we talked about what Project Shatterstone is all about so this time we will talk about something a little more interesteing. Forewarning, I can't guarantee there won't be spoilers, but as I don't have any puzzles drawn out yet and am still designing so outside of revealing the mechanism/tech I hid the puzzle in I think it should be ok. 

Anyway, let's talk about the hellish nightmare that is phones!

A few years ago before Shatterstone, I was sitting around thinking about weird halloween props and was thinking it would be spooky to have a phone that would ring at random. The person might pick up the phone to get a mysterious or scary message. And how spooky would it be if you physically picked up the phone and discovered there was no wire to the wall?
