[Last time](https://anmtblog.com/shatterstone/2024/04/07/Shatterstone1.html) we talked about what Project Shatterstone is all about so this time we will talk about something a little more interesteing. Forewarning, I can't guarantee there won't be spoilers, but as I don't have any puzzles drawn out yet and am still designing so outside of revealing the mechanism/tech I hid the puzzle in I think it should be ok. 

Anyway, let's talk about the hellish nightmare that is phones!

A few years ago before Shatterstone, I was sitting around thinking about weird halloween props and was thinking it would be spooky to have a phone that would ring at random. The person might pick up the phone to get a mysterious or scary message. And how spooky would it be if you physically picked up the phone and discovered there was no wire to the wall? So I bought a phone and I stripped all the guts out of it and wired in a raspberry pi. But I never finished it, because phones as it turns out are way tougher than I expected.

When you open up a phone some stuff is obvious and soe stuff isn't. First, phonelines don't work on your home power. If you had a home line and your power went out, then you can still make a phone call. That is because phones are powered at the source. In this case the phone company or an intermediary. This has a lot to do with how phones started and well it worked so we didn't need more. Doesn't mean that you didn't need to plug your phone in, but really you only needed to do that for the extra stuff on the phone (lcd screen etc). OK, that is the generic history of phones. Let's keep moving since that isn't going to move us forward much.
