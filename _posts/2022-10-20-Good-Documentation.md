Writing good docs are TOUGH. You have to play this game of trying to keep people's attention span while also not talking down to them, while not being too complex, while patting your head and rubbing your belly, and juggling. So how do you white good docs for all those scenarios? First, and this is good advice for most things I think, abaondon all hope. You won't get it right 100% of the time so give up on  that idea. We can aim for some success though if we follow some rules.

A person's name is to the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
